                            <p>The Euro is down to 1.048, after ending yesterday at 1.0481. Overall, a 0.01% loss or 1 pips today.</p>
                            <p>The MACD index is indicating that momentum is shifting from bullish to bearish following a negative crossover. When the MACD falls below the signal line, it is typically considered to be a bearish development favoring short positions. On the other hand, note that the Relative Strength Index has gone below 30, going into oversold conditions and allowing more gains. Euro-Dollar's lower Bollinger BandÂ® is at 1.0476, indicating that the asset has overextended to the downside and could, therefore, bounce back as buyers look for bargains.</p>
                            <p>Overall, looking at the technical analysis landscape, it seems that although indicators are mixed and some are pointing in different directions further drawbacks may be next for the Euro.</p>
                            <p>Positive performances can be seen by looking at other currencies as GBP/NZD increases 0.19% to trade around 2.035. EUR/NZD increases 0.18% to trade around 1.764.</p>
                            <p>n the meantime, USD/SGD trades close to 1.3734, with no major change</p>
                            <p>The currency pair has been trending lower for about 2 months. The Euro has shed 78.55% over the past three months.</p>
